Recently, I was asked the following question: If you were an animal, which animal would you be?

I would say a dragonfly, if an insect could also be considered an animal. As someone who grew up on the country side, I had always been fascinated by dragonflies. The dragonfly nymph is really ugly, it looks like a little monster if you look closely. But through its own metamorphosis, it becomes a really elegant flying machine. 

So, regardless of the background you have, the environment you were born in, through you own hard work, you can metamorphose yourself into something as elegant as a dragonfly.
