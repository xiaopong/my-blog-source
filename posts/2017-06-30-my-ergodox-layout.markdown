The Ergodox is a very configurable keyboard, too configurable, actually. I have lost count of the number of times I have tweaked it, but here is [my latest layout](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/4DO73/latest/0). This layout is "optimized" for coding and Emacs-style keymap, as you may see. All the modifier keys and programming symbols are easily accessible without moving long distances. It may not be the most efficient layout for everyone, but it is for me.
