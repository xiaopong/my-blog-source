A big tsunami, carrying a big wave, was rushing to the shore. A kid was hit first.
He struggled to keep his head above water, while paddling
with all the strength of his arms. A few other kids nearby were running for
for high ground.

Meanwhile, on the shore, a bunch of fat kids were jeering at the drowning kid,
saying that he paddled it wrong. As other kids ran by and yelled at the
fat kits to take refuge, some fat kits anxiously looked up at the fattest of
the bunch for direction on what to do next. The biggest and fattest kid
patted them on the back: "We will be fine. We are fat, unlike him, we will
float. And we all have life buoy, do we not?" Barely had he finished his sentence
that a big wave smashed on their head, and they were now all under water.

Miraculously, through determination and grit, the first kid has now reached the
dry land, and running to take refuge on high ground.

The fattest kid, in between gasps of breadth, complained that the first kid was
playing foul, by not notifying him of the intensity of the wave.
