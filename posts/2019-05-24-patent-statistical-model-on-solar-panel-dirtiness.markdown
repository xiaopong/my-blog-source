As I have written in a previous post, I was working with a client company that develops robotic systems to clean up solar panels. I was responsible for designing and implementing the algorithm to detect the dustiness level of the panels, and determine if it is worth cleaning up or not.

We have done some great works there, and have applied for a few patents in China in 2017. Yesterday, we received the notification that one of the patents I've written has been issued. 

That patent used a statistical model to compute the dustiness score of the solar panels, which will be fed into the decision making component of the management system.

That was fun.
