title: About
---
I am a computer programmer. Some would prefer the more pompous title of software engineer,
but programming seems to reflect the reality of our work better.

I have worked on telecom switches, content management systems, financial trading systems,
e-payment platforms, large internet platforms, robotic systems, etc. I work mostly
on the server side.

I do, and have worked with in the past, Java, Scala, Haskell, Erlang, Rust, C/C++, Ada.
Whenever possible, I prefer to work with strongly typed programming languages, especially for large projects.

In my spare time, I love to read, write codes for my own experimenting, painting, and
play a little music (I am a very lousy musician).
